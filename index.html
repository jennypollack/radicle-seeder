    <pre>
    Your full Seeder Reward amount is <b>5000 RAD tokens.</b>
    You were airdropped this complete amount but upon receipt, 
    10% of the Seeder Reward (500 RAD) are deemed <b>fully unlocked.</b>
    
    The rest of the Seeder Reward will be progressively unlocked 
    daily over the course of 1 year.
    
    Here is the formula for calculating your unlocked tokens
    Starting on the first calendar day after receiving the Seeder Reward 
    (February 20th) until the first anniversary of such event, 
    the Locked Tokens will become unlocked on a daily rate, 
    so that the aggregate number of Unlocked Tokens 
    (i.e., including such Initial Unlocked Tokens) 
    at any relevant day shall be equal to “N” as determined as follows:
    
    <b>N = (0.1 + D/365*0.9) * T</b> 
    
    whereas
    D = Total number of calendar days from receipt of Seeder Reward
    T = Total number of tokens (5000)
